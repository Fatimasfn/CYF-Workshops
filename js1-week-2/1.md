# Predict => Run => Observe => Explain

Remember to **preview a markdown file** on your computer you can do:
Ctr + Shift + V (Windows/Linux) or CMD + Shift + V (Mac)

In this task, you'll need to look at some code in `1.js` and, firstly, predict what it will do, **without executing it**.

{I predict the console will output on defined, as just a variable current year has been initialized. My prediction were wrong, it threw an error because the variable was called a function.}

Afterwards, you can execute the code in `1.js` to check your answer üìù
