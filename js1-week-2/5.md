You've started to see **assertions** in your coursework that look something like this:

```js
expect(sum(10,32)).toBe(42);


a) Describe, in your own words, what the above assertion checks.
compare the expected value of sum(10,32) with (42) and if true the test passed else it fails.
the .tobe matcher is equivalent to === absolute equality.

Now try the following:

b) Write an **assertion** that checks that a function `isMultipleOfTen` returns `true` when called with the input `80`
You can check out the [Jest documentation here](https://jestjs.io/docs/expect#matchers) to help you with this task.

 function isMultipleOfTen(num)){
    num % 10 === 0;
 }

 test('should return true for input of 80', ()=>{
    expect (isMultipleOfTen(80)).tobe(true)
 });
